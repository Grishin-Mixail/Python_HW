You may have heard about the Python programming language before. It is often talked about as the next “up and coming” programming language, or described as being a new, “trendy” programming language that everyone should be learning, particularly scientists. I would argue that Python is no longer merely “up and coming”, or even particularly new, but one of the most popular and useful programming languages you could invest time in learning. In fact, as of 2018, Python is (by certain measures) the most widely used programming language in the world. So if you are a scientist, researcher, or student doing any kind of data analysis, or numeric programming, then I think Python is worth investing some time in learning, even just the basics.

Python is a programming language, a tool used to make computers do useful things for scientific coders much faster than they could do using conventional tools like spreadsheets or plotting software (and certainly much faster than manual calculations!). But programming languages are not really designed for computers at all. In fact, your computer has no idea what all the words and symbols in a piece of code written in Python actually mean. It only understands ones and zeros and electrical currents. Programming languages are actually designed for humans to have a convenient way of programming a computer without getting involved in things like binary and hexadecimal codes, and worrying about electronic circuitry inside the computer.
